today: measuring light

radiant energy: energy of electromagnetic radiation (joules, $Q$). radiant flux: energy emitted, reflected, received etc. per unit time (watt = $dQ/dt$)

photometry: ignores light that humans cannot see. e.g. luminous flux = integrate radiant flux over eye's luminous efficiency cuve

- all radiometric quantities (e.g. watts) has equivalents in photometry (lumens, candela)

radiant intensity: intensity of light emitted from source. (watts/sr). sr = "3D radians"

irradiance: amount of light falling on a surface: watts/$m^2$. lambert's cosine law!

radiance: amount of light traveling along a ray (conserved in vacuum): watts/(sr $\times \ m^2$)

- also described as radiant intensity per unit emitting area; subjectively described as brightness

- incident, exiting surface radiance, field radiance

irradiance = integral of radiance weighted by lambert's law
