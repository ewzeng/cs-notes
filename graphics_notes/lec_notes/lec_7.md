today: intro to geometry

how to store/define/rep geo in a computer?

implicit rep of geo: defined implicitly by equation. sampling may be hard (hard to find all points of shape). inside/outside test often easy. descriptions compact; can often get exact decription.

- algebraic surfaces
- constructive solid geometry (can apply boolean operations)
- blobbly surfaces (use Guassian + level sets)
- level sets
- fractals
- distance functions?? (I don't really understand)

explicit rep of geo: all points given directly (either stored in memory or a direct computation of stuff stored in memory). sampling easy. inside/outisde test hard. (class spends more time here)

- point cloud = a list of colored points (can represent any geo)
- triangle meshes (require complicated data structures)
- bezier surfaces
- subdivsion (a good averaging rule gives smooth curve)
