today: intro to animation

aesthetic issues often dominate technical issues

animation principles:

- animation specific: sketch and squash (define rigidity/mass of object by how it moves)
- general acting: anticipation (prepare for each movement to direct audience's attention), staging (make audience look at right place), exaggeration (to make points clear)
- realism: follow motions through, ease motions in/out (motion doesn't start/end abruptly), arcs (move in curves not lines), show secondary action (motion that results from other actions)
- storytelling: know purpose and mood before animating each action

keyframe animation: lead animator creates key frames, assistant (person or computer) creates in-between frames

- key: keyframe interpolation (recall: splines)
