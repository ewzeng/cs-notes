today: cameras

overview:

- shutter exposes sensor; sensor accumulates irradiance during exposure (and coverts to electrical charge). need lens/pinhole to project rays onto sensor correctly, else each sensor point will take light rays from all points in the scene (obv if you think about it)

- image processing: sensor values $\rightarrow$ image

pinhole camera: not really used

focal length (dist to pinhole/lens) & sensor size determines FOV. small sensor size = can fit less pixels. increasing focal length is the "zoom" in physical cameras

exposure = time $\times$ irradiance, irradiance controlled by lens aperture & focal length

aperture: opening in lens that light passes through; ISO gain: amplification between sensor values and digital image values
