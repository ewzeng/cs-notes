F-number of lens = focal length / aperture. (fix lens $\rightarrow$ fix focal point. then F-number depends on the possible apertures of lens). good cameras can achieve small F-numbers.

depth of field: range of object depths that are rendered with acceptable sharpness. defined by circle of confusion size

hyperfocal distance: focus distance that maximizes the depth of field (i.e. far focus plane at $\infty$)

aesthetics: bokeh - shape and quality of out-of-focus blur

real compound lens are highly complex, based on snell's law (try to approx ideal thin lens)

lens are designed by ray tracing the designs, and seeing the results
