out of gamut is unavoidable

we store color as 3D value of RGB. sRGB is monitor standard (else different monitors will give slightly different colors given the same 3D value)

CIE RGB (another standard)

CIE XYZ (defines imaginary color primaries that can mix to get any observable color). a standard for representing any color we want with numbers, but not actually implementable
