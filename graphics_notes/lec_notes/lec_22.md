out of gamut is unavoidable

we store color as 3D value of RGB. sRGB is monitor standard (else different monitors will give slightly different colors given the same 3D value)

CIE RGB (another RGB standard): used in color matching experiment

color matching function $s_R$: if $s$ is spectrum, $\int s_R \times s =$ amount of red we need for color reproduction

CIE XYZ (defines imaginary color primaries that can mix to get any observable color, i.e. only need non-negative linear combos). standard for representing any color we want (esp. gamuts), but not actually implementable

- Y is luminance; chromaticity: normalized XYZ coords
- CIE XYZ chromaticity graph: plot the XY chromaticity coordinates, used to represent gamuts of color spaces
- the non-negative restriction is b/c of historical reasons

gamut = set of chromaticities generated by set of primaries (i.e. convex hull of primary chromaticities)

horseshoe on CIE XYZ chromaticity graph = set of chromaticities we see = convex hull of all colors we see

HSV color space: easier to find colors than moving RGB sliders, used by artists

CIE XYZ is perceptual non-uniform: regions of perceptually equivalent color vary in size across CIE XYZ chromaticity graph

- solution: CIE LAB space: a perceptual uniform space (also uses theory of opponent colors)
