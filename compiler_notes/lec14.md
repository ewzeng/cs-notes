##### Introduction to Runtime Organization

last stage of compiler: code generation + optimization

virtual machine = compiler's target

to improve speed and size: minimize instruction counts, maximize register use, keep data structures static (e.g. use lookup tables). to improve complication speed: try to keep analyses as local as possible
