uxvyw theorem: analogue of pumping lemma for context-free grammars (used to prove languages not describable by BNF)

now: static semantic analysis (turn AST into annotated tree). basically annotates the AST with additional information

- goals: find declarations that defines each idenitifier instance, determine static types

scope of declaration: section of text (or program execution) in which declaration applies. declarative regions. environment diagrams!
