# Web Security

In the last set of notes, we discussed network security. In particular, we examined attacks on the network itself, like spoofing packets, DDOS, DNS cache poisoning, etc. In this set of notes, we will discuss web security, which is more concerned with attacks associated to websites and web services \(i.e. stuff that run on the network\), like malicious javascript and stealing cookies.
