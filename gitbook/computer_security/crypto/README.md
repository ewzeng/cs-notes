# Cryptography

In this next set of notes, we will discuss __cryptography__, one of the most fundamental topics of computer security. In particular, we will cover __symmetric-key__ and __asymmetric-key encryption__.

As a warning: do __not__ ever write your own cryptography. Use provided libraries. Implementing cryptography is trickier than understanding it conceptually because one must be careful of things like side channel and timing attacks.
