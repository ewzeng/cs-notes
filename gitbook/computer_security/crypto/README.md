# Cryptography

In this next set of notes, we will discuss **cryptography**, one of the most fundamental topics of computer security. Here is a layout of the major topics we will cover:

|  | Symmetric-Key | Asymmetric-Key |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Confidentiality | Symmetric-Key Encryption | Asymmetric-Key Encryption |
| Integrity/Authentication | MACs | Digital Signatures |

As a warning: unless there is a good reason, do **not** write your own cryptography. Use provided libraries. Implementing cryptography is trickier than understanding it conceptually because one must be careful of things like side channel and timing attacks.
