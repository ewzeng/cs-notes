password for Q2.3 is botnet (missed the beginning)

gradescope entry code (MZ6KZX)

often the most effective security is to attack the attacker's motivation

the question "is this secure" is not good b/c its almost surely not secure against an attacker with enough resources + money

- better question: is this secure against xxx? (xxx being the people that might attack you)
  - this is a question of "reasonably secure"

need to make security system usable (or people won't use it or will subvert it). example: if company requires passwords to be too complex, people might just write it on a post-it note and stick it on the desktop
